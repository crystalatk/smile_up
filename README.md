# SmileUp

## Purpose

This app was designed specifically for the Smile Up Charitable Foundation to be the primary member-tracking-system for its growing pool of volunteers. Smile Up envisions a world where young people are leading the charge in volunteerism through awareness, advocacy and action. The SmileUp app provides a safe and secure system for tracking volunteers and events. The app also improves efficiency of tracking various volunteer data, which was previously entered by hand by the nonprofit administrator.

## Who is the app for?

The SmileUp app was built around the three primary user types: administrators, volunteers, and guardians. As a result of SmileUpâ€™s mission to encourage children under the age of 18 to volunteer, nearly all of the volunteers are minors.
